# The two roots OpenCode reads that the harness installs nothing into, and empties instead.
#
# OpenCode resolves skills from four global roots, in this order, highest first (probed by planting
# colliding canaries and reading `opencode debug skill` back, not inferred):
#
#   $OPENCODE_HOME/skills  >  $OPENCODE_HOME/skill  >  ~/.agents/skills  >  ~/.claude/skills
#
# Claude Code reads only the last of those. So a skill in either root below loads in OpenCode and
# not in Claude Code, which is the divergence this harness exists to prevent — and because both
# outrank ~/.claude/skills, a name the harness *does* ship can be shadowed there by a different
# copy, which diverges the two runtimes while every file the installer wrote is still on disk.
#
# Neither is installed into. OpenCode auto-loads ~/.claude/skills directly and unconditionally, so
# the harness's skills already reach it without a second copy; adding one would be double state
# that drifts (`§26`), which is the same reason bootstrap-harness tells Codex to read
# .claude/skills through the bridge rather than mirror into .agents/skills.
#
# The two resolve differently on purpose. The singular is OpenCode's own, so it follows OpenCode's
# home and honours XDG_CONFIG_HOME like everything else under it. ~/.agents answers to no config
# home at all — OpenCode reads it straight off HOME, with nothing to redirect it — so it is the one
# skills root that is shared across all three Claude Code profiles on this laptop rather than being
# one profile's. That gives it the shape CLAUDE_HOOKS has and the same cost, stated where that one
# states it: every profile's install purges this one directory, and none of them knows the others
# exist. Unlike the hooks case there is nothing left dangling by that — an emptied root is emptied
# for everyone, which is what all three profiles wanted anyway.

# knows. $HOME is the one root Claude Code, OpenCode and a sandbox all agree on (same reason the
# machine-local notes sit under it), so a $HOME-anchored bin is the single copy every caller can
# name. It sits beside those notes under ~/.lazar-harness but in its own subdir: bin is the

# Prose that differs by environment is authored in the markdown it belongs to, between a

# the surface being installed while dropping the rest. Both variants therefore sit next to each
# other in the file someone edits and reviews, rather than one of them living as a heredoc in this
# script, and a second file needing the treatment costs no change here at all.
#
# What differs is only ever the default action. `§28` states the isolation principle for every
# surface. A block that contradicted the other variant rather than adapting it would be two
# harnesses, not one.
#
# `sandbox` says the working copy is not shared, there is no GUI, and the run is ephemeral. It does
# not say nobody is watching: an Open Inspect session someone is driving and an unattended
# automation run are both this surface. So a block that turns on whether a human can answer settles
# that from what the skill is for, never from the flag. `lazar-pr-status` is always Alex driving, so
# it asks first and treats no answer as a no. A second flag for attendedness would be a knob no caller
# can set correctly.
#
# Staged like every other write here, so a file that fails to render leaves the previous install in
# place rather than a half-written one. Every failure below is a mis-authored source: an unclosed
# block silently truncates at the marker, and a missing block silently ships one surface the other

# config home, so one script serves every profile that points at it and three copies would only give
# three things to drift. That is also why this is a plain shared path and not the symlink the skills
# dir uses — a symlink is there to make a directory appear under a home that globs it, and nothing
# globs this one, so the link would be indirection bought for a lookup that never happens.
