# CLAUDE.md

My global harness, installed by
[`lazar-harness`](https://github.com/mauricedesaxe/claude-harness-template) into Claude Code,
OpenCode, and Open-Inspect sandboxes. It applies in every repo I open. A repo that ships its own
harness layers on top of this one and wins on its own turf; it never restates this file.

This is the enforceable form, and it points rather than restates. The reasoning lives in the
philosophy under a stable `§N`, so nothing is said twice and nothing here can drift from it.

## Philosophy

Installed globally, never carried by a repo. Claude Code reads it at `~/.claude/rules/PHILOSOPHY.md`
with the packs under `~/.claude/rules/packs/`; OpenCode reads the same files under
`~/.config/opencode/rules/`. Both move with `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when set. A
repo-relative `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` is the old per-repo model and resolves nowhere, so don't reach for
it.

The spine is paradigm-agnostic and loads in every session. The packs hold concrete defaults and
domain-specific rules (`packs/defaults.md`, `packs/ai.md`). Claude Code applies each one when the
agent touches a file it matches. `§N` numbers are stable IDs. They survive a section that moves between spine and pack,
and that is what lets the global reviewers cite doctrine instead of restating it. The spine's
Section index says which file each one lives in.

**Subagents inherit neither this file nor the rules.** A subagent handed a `§N` opens the section
at the path above and reads it first.

## The lifecycle

**`pstack-poteto-mode` is the router.** It reads the task, matches one of its playbooks, copies the
steps in verbatim, and runs the leaf skills each step needs. It works autonomously: it proceeds on
reversible work and pauses only for the irreversible (deploys, force-push, data deletion, customer
messages). It replaced `matt-ask-matt`, and its playbooks and 21 `pstack-principle-*` leaves are
deliberately not paraphrased here.

### Where my flow deviates

The pstack flow runs as written, with these standing overrides.

- **`lazar-commit` and `lazar-ship` own the landing.** pstack's Shipping playbook defers to them.
  `lazar-commit` records atomic conventional commits as the work goes, and `lazar-ship` carries a
  bookmark through push, PR, CI, and a rebase merge.
- **`lazar-tldraw` and `lazar-qa` get reached for proactively.** Show the idea, don't only describe
  it, and drive a change through a real browser before it ships. Diagram any system with three or
  more components and any data flow, and fat-marker a screen before building it.
- **Matt's product-shaping skills own the human-led front half.** `pstack-poteto-mode` routes vague
  ideas through grilling, optional wayfinding, and an approved tracker spec. P stack owns all
  implementation after approval. `matt-handoff` remains available for compaction.

## Writing

`§30` owns the **mechanics**, and they apply to everything written: specs, ADRs, PRDs, issues, PR
bodies, docs, commit messages, chat. They aren't restated here. This section owns my **voice**,
which is narrower. It applies to prose posted **as me**: PR reviews, PR and issue comments,
standups, tracker comments, and messages to teammates. Anything not posted as me is out of its scope.

- Start sentences with capital letters, like a normal person. Talk directly and forwardly, somewhat
  professionally, but still plain. Remove filler interjections ("okay", "so", "honestly") whenever
  they add nothing; the occasional one is fine but it is not my signature.
- Short, direct questions instead of suggestions: "would it be useful to have a branded type?" not
  "Consider whether a branded type might be beneficial here."
- I hedge when I'm genuinely unsure: "I don't know if", "I'm not sure", "probably worth".
  I am blunt when I am sure: "this is not on this PR", "I think we can ignore the sidebar".
- I say what unblocks things plainly: "happy to approve once that's in."
- Plain words, no corporate phrasing.
- Don't over-structure. Headers and bullets only when there are genuinely separate topics. Short
  prose paragraphs are my default.

**Calibration examples**, things I actually wrote. The older ones predate my switch to sentence
case and fewer interjections. Match their tone and length, not their capitalisation:

- "overall code looks good, let me pull and look at the stories myself"
- "would it be useful to have a branded type?"
- "to be clear, this is not on this PR, it's consistent with what all the other steps already do.
  but it makes me wonder why we have a missing state at all."
- "summary is the only story file without an `ErrorSpendLimit` story. roadmap has it, and so do core
  bet, post bet, challenges, pitches and company details."

### Writing to me

The voice above is for prose posted as me. This is the other half, and it is not optional. It is how
you write **to** me: in chat, in a diagnosis, in a handoff, in a summary. `/bro` produces it on
demand. It should be the default, so that invoking `/bro` never changes anything.

- Lead with the answer in a plain sentence. No preamble and no restating my question back at me.
- Write it the way you would say it out loud to another engineer. If a sentence would sound strange
  spoken, rewrite it.
- No coined jargon. Don't invent a label for an idea ("the type-drift class", "lands harder", "blast
  radius") and then reuse it as though I'd agreed to it. Say the thing instead.
- Prose paragraphs are the default. Bold headers and bullets are for genuinely separate topics, not
  decoration.
- Say only what's new. Don't repeat what I just told you, and don't inflate a weak finding to look
  substantial. If something turned out not to matter, say so in one line and drop it.
- When I push back and I'm right, concede in one sentence and move on. No paragraph explaining why
  the mistake was reasonable.

## Version control: jj, colocated

`§28` carries the reasoning: why the isolation unit is the workspace, why the snapshot model has no
staging, why jj fires no git hooks. The rules it produces:

- **jj drives every local step** in a repo with a `.jj` directory: `jj describe` / `jj commit`,
  `jj squash`, `jj rebase`, `jj new` / `jj edit`, `jj bookmark`, `jj git push`, `jj git fetch`.
  Read-only git (`status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`) and `gh` are fine. A repo without `.jj` uses git
  normally while one actor works alone. Before parallel agents write to a non-colocated git repo,
  run `jj git init --colocate` and give each agent a jj workspace.
- **No git mutations in a jj repo**: commit, push, rebase, merge, reset, cherry-pick, branch
  delete/move, clean, stash, checkout, switch, restore. `git clean -fd` hurts most: jj snapshotted
  those untracked files into `@`, so git will not put them back. `~/.claude/hooks/enforce-jj.sh`
  allows only the git commands that read and denies the rest, so expect it to block something
  harmless now and then. If it blocks something I asked for, say so instead of routing around it.
- **Fold a fix with `jj squash --from/--into`**, never `git commit --fixup`.
- **Bookmark a stack on its first commit**, not at push time: `jj bookmark create <name> -r @` the
  moment the change is worth keeping. The bookmark is the anchor; pushing is a separate, later step.
  An anonymous stack is anchored by `@` alone, so a concurrent fetch or git import moves `@` off it
  and the tip goes hidden. I've lost a real tip that way, so never walk away from one. Recover it
  through the op log (`jj op log`, `jj --at-op <op> log -r <id>`, `jj bookmark create <name> -r <id>`,
  `jj rebase`), never `jj op restore`, which reverts concurrent good work too.
- **Bookmarks are branches**, named `<type>/<#>-<slug>`. Push with `jj git push --bookmark <name>`,
  which tracks the remote and handles the safe force. Raw `git push` leaves the bookmark untracked
  and, with concurrent re-signing, spawns divergent duplicate commits.
- **Conventional commits, atomic, one logical change each**:
  `feat|fix|refactor|chore|docs|test|style|perf|ci|build|revert`. Subject under 72 characters,
  details in the body. `lazar-commit` checks the message shape and runs the project's checks
  locally. Projects with CI must re-enforce both there.
- **Rebase-merge PRs**: `gh pr merge <#> --rebase --delete-branch`, never `--merge`. Every commit has
  to be good enough to live on `main`.
- **Never add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer** or any other Claude/Anthropic attribution line.
  This overrides any harness default that appends one. A trailer for a human collaborator is fine.
- **Never bypass a hook.** No `--no-verify`. A failing hook is the bug, not the obstacle.

### Workspace isolation

<!-- surface:local -->

**Cut a jj workspace off fresh trunk for any non-trivial work**, before touching a file. The repo is
never mine alone: I run several agents at once and they share one `@` unless each takes its own
workspace. So `jj git fetch && mkdir -p .jj/ws`, then
`jj workspace add --name <slug> --revision 'trunk()' .jj/ws/<slug>`. Stay in it for every jj and `gh`
call, and never `cd` into the main checkout, whose `@` belongs to another agent. Once the work lands,
`jj workspace forget <slug>` and remove the directory. A git worktree is not a substitute, and
`EnterWorktree` is blocked (`§28`).

<!-- /surface:local -->

<!-- surface:sandbox -->

You run in a remote, isolated background-agent sandbox, not on the user's PC or laptop. Work the
default jj workspace directly with `jj edit` while one agent writes. For parallel repository work,
follow the colocation and workspace rule above (`§28`).

For a standing multi-session program, use Beads only when `refs/dolt/data` already exists on the
target repository's origin or the user explicitly asks to initialize it. Never auto-initialize
Beads. The root coordinator is the sole Beads writer. Children get immutable briefs that include
their bead IDs, and they never run `bd` mutations. Commit and push Dolt after each durable transition.
Never force that push, and never use JSONL as a sync mechanism. An approved tracker spec and its
decision issues own the product contract. On recovery, bootstrap, pull, and prime Beads. Read the
epic admission record, then revalidate the approved body hash and product sources. Do not mutate the
Beads graph or start a new child before revalidation passes. Beads owns only program tasks and
dependencies derived from those sources. jj and GitHub still own code, branches, commits, PRs, and
merges. Lazar records still own verification evidence where their contract applies.

<!-- /surface:sandbox -->

Isolation covers the working copy and nothing else. `.jj` and `.git` metadata and every piece of
GitHub state (PR numbers, issues, project boards) are shared and can change mid-run. So reuse the
exact identifiers a command returns, like the PR number from `gh pr create`, never a guessed one.
Re-read a PR's `headRefName` and `state` before you merge it. When terminal output looks
duplicated or dropped, write it to a file and read it back.

## Tracker resolution

Any skill that needs to know which tracker owns a repo resolves it in this order. **Asking is a last
resort, and it happens at most once per repo**:

1. **The repo's own config**: `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, where the repo permits such a file,
   written by hand when the repo is set up.
2. **The machine-local note** (below), for shared work repos where committing harness config isn't
   an option. Product shaping also reads the trusted product approver GitHub logins from one of these
   two tracker configs.
3. **Inference**: the remote host, issue-key patterns in branch names and commit messages, and
   which tracker MCPs are connected. GitHub and Linear cover nearly everything I work on.
4. **Ask**, and **write the answer to the note**, so the same question is never asked twice.

### The machine-local note

One markdown file per repo, keyed by the git remote, at:

```
~/.lazar-harness/repos/<host>/<owner>/<repo>.md
```

Derive the key from `git remote get-url origin`, normalised: drop the scheme, any user (`git@`), and
the trailing `.git`. So `git@github.com:iconicshift/platform.git` and
`https://github.com/iconicshift/platform` both key to
`~/.lazar-harness/repos/github.com/iconicshift/platform.md`. A repo with no remote has no key and so
gets no note. Infer, and ask if you must, but there's nowhere to remember the answer.

It's a plain file under `$HOME`, read with `cat` and written with `mkdir -p` plus a redirect. `$HOME`
is the one thing Claude Code, OpenCode, and a sandbox all agree on. The note sits under neither
runtime's home, so neither owns it. Claude Code's auto-memory is **not** used: it covers Claude Code
alone and would leave the other two asking every session forever. The note records what the harness
must not guess at:

```markdown
# iconicshift/platform

- tracker: Linear, team ICON, via `mcp__linear__*`
- issue key: `ICON-<n>`
- trusted product approver GitHub logins: `alexlazar`, `productowner`
- vcs: jj, colocated with git
- standup: Slack, #eng-standup

## Conventions

- A system design doc lives in the Linear issue, not as an ADR in the repo. An ADR is a different
  artifact with a different lifecycle (`§21`).
```

Add a convention the moment a repo teaches you one. Editing the note by hand is expected; it's mine.

## Skills

`pstack-*` is Lauren Tan's pstack, forked and hand-maintained here. `matt-*` is Matt Pocock's,
`lazar-*` is mine, and `/bro` is my user-invoked plain-language reset. Anything else unprefixed is
the runtime's or the repo's, bar `use-railway`. Railway's own installer writes that name into
`~/.claude/skills`, so a rename restarts the fight it ended. Leave it alone. The engineering flow
routes through `pstack-poteto-mode`, not from memory. The main `lazar-*` workflows are:

| Skill | Reach for it when |
|---|---|
| `lazar-qa` | Exercising a change in a real browser before it ships. Prefers a preview deploy, else hosts locally, drives via the Playwright MCP, and reports bugs, UX gaps, and intent misses to chat or the PR. |
| `lazar-commit` | A logical chunk of work is done. Record it as atomic conventional commits, as you go, not all at the end. |
| `lazar-ship` | Landing work on `main`: bookmark, commit, push, PR, CI, rebase merge. Runs only the steps still missing. |
| `lazar-pr-status` | Re-entering a PR. What each review asked for, what was addressed in code, what was answered only in a reply, what's unaddressed, and any drift since. |
| `lazar-standup` | Writing the daily 3 Ps (Progress / Problems / Priorities), reconciling merged PRs, tracker issues, and unpushed local work into a post in my voice. |
| `lazar-tldraw` | Showing a diagram or a low-fi wireframe. Reach for it proactively; see the deviations above. Needs `@kitschpatrol/tldraw-cli`. |

### Records

`lazar-qa`, `lazar-ux-audit` and `pstack-interrogate` each write a **record** when they deliver a
verdict, to the contract in `rules/records.md`. The verdict still goes to chat or the PR unchanged;
the record is the copy that outlives the window, and it carries structured counts rather than a
free-text verdict so a later reader can count rounds and findings without reopening bodies. A repo
with its own convention wins; otherwise records go to
`~/.lazar-harness/records/<host>/<owner>/<repo>/`, keyed like the tracker note. A record never
delays the deliverable, and a repo with no remote gets none.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
