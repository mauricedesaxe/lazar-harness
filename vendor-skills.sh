# Not a special case in the rewrite so much as absent from the set it runs over: the prefix loop

# carries for pstack is a pristine-upstream content hash per skill, so `--check-pstack-drift` can

  (no flags)            Re-vendor the set pinned in skills-lock.json. Fails if upstream has moved
                        away from the pinned content hashes. Carries the pstack pins through
                        unchanged; the skills CLI does not fetch pstack.
  --update              Pull every CLI-fetched upstream's current content and repin
                        skills-lock.json to it. Preserves the hand-maintained pstack pins.
  --update-matt         Pull Matt's selected skills without changing any other upstream pin.
  --update-plannotator  Pull Plannotator and visual-explainer without changing the other pins.
  --regen-patch         Rebuild patches/lazar-tldraw.patch from the difference between pristine
                        upstream and the vendored skills/lazar-tldraw/SKILL.md. Run this after
                        editing that file to keep a local change across the next re-vendor.
  --check-pstack-drift  Fetch each pinned pstack skill's pristine upstream and compare its hash to
                        skills-lock.json. Reports which skills upstream has changed under the fork,
                        so the divergence is reconciled by hand rather than discovered by accident.
